# AI Model Match

AI Model Match is an open-source service that helps product teams release, test, and optimize prompt configurations for AI-powered applications. It transforms the traditionally manual, trial-and-error process into an automated system that continuously identifies the best-performing configurations for each use case.

By organizing AI experimentation into use cases, flows, and steps, AI Model Match allows product teams to rapidly test different strategies, collect real feedback, and deliver AI experiences that continuously improve.

## üöÄ Overview

AI Model Match enables teams to:

- Define **use cases** as product goals, such as providing recommendations, generating content, or planning a trip.
- Create **flows**, representing multiple candidate strategies to achieve each goal.
- Organize flows into **steps**, precise configurations that guide AI behavior at each stage of the interaction.
- Intelligently distribute traffic across flows to maintain consistency while optimizing performance.
- Collect and use feedback from both end users and product teams to automatically improve AI performance.

This system empowers product managers to iterate independently, accelerate release cycles, and minimize risk, while end users benefit from AI interactions that steadily improve.

## üìê Core Concepts

1. **Use Case**

   - Represents a specific product goal or objective.
   - Defines the scope of experimentation and the metrics for success.

2. **Flow**

   - A candidate configuration or strategy to achieve a use case.
   - Multiple flows can be defined to explore different approaches.

3. **Step**

   - Each flow is composed of steps, with each step defining a precise prompt configuration.
   - Steps allow fine-grained control of AI behavior at each stage of interaction.

4. **Session & Correlation ID**

   - Each user session is tied to a unique correlation ID.
   - Once a flow is selected for a correlation ID, all subsequent steps in that session use the same flow, ensuring predictable and coherent experiences.

5. **Feedback**
   - Ratings (1‚Äì5) and optional notes can be submitted for each session.
   - Feedback is aggregated per flow to guide automated flow selection and optimization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Rollout Strategy

AI Model Match automates the rollout of flows using a controlled, multi-phase approach:

1. **Warmup**

   - New flows are gradually introduced until they reach a target traffic percentage.

2. **Adaptive**

   - Traffic is automatically shifted toward higher-performing flows based on feedback.
   - Flows that receive positive feedback gain more traffic until one flow converges to 100%.

3. **Escape**
   - Configurable rollback conditions trigger automatic reversion if a flow underperforms (e.g., ‚â•10 evaluations with an average score < 2/5).
   - Protects user experience while minimizing risks.

## üí° Benefits

**For Product Managers**

- Accelerates iteration cycles without heavy engineering dependency.
- Provides a data-driven approach to evaluating AI strategies.
- Enables safe experimentation with automated traffic distribution and rollback.

**For End Users**

- Consistent, high-quality AI experiences.
- Interactions improve over time based on real-world feedback.

**Business Value**

- Reduces time and cost of AI experimentation.
- Identifies the best-performing strategies quickly.
- Lowers risk while scaling successful configurations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- AI Model Match is implemented as an open-source **microservice**.
- Provides APIs to external systems for runtime prompt configuration.
- Supports fine-grained control over AI interactions through use cases, flows, and steps.
- Correlation IDs ensure consistent execution across multi-step flows.
- Feedback collection APIs enable automated performance evaluation and optimization.
- Can be deployed standalone or integrated with existing production environments.
- Future plans may include a **SaaS version** to abstract deployment and infrastructure management.

## üìà How It Works

1. Define a **use case** representing a product goal.
2. Create one or more **flows** with structured **steps** for AI behavior.
3. Release the flows and let AI Model Match manage traffic distribution and feedback collection.
4. Monitor performance as the system automatically optimizes flow selection based on real-world data.

## üéØ Target Audience

- **Product Managers** looking to test AI strategies quickly and independently.
- **Development Teams** integrating AI-driven workflows into their applications.
- **End Users** who benefit from AI interactions that are consistent, coherent, and continuously improving.
